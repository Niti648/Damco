A Test Summary Report (TSR) for a complex system like the Google Search Engine would typically provide an overview of the testing activities, results, and status for the project. 
Please note that Google's internal testing practices and specific details of their test summary reports are not publicly disclosed, 
so the following is a general outline of what a TSR for such a project might include:
